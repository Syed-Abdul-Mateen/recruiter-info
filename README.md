## Selected Projects

**1. AI-Driven Real-Time Cyberattack Detection System**  
Developed a real-time packet sniffer and analyzer using Scapy, Flask, and NetworkX. Captures and classifies over 1000 packets/min and generates automated PDF anomaly reports.

**2. Suspicious Process Activity Detector**  
Built a system-level tool that monitors and auto-terminates blacklisted processes. Includes a rule-based detection engine and real-time GUI dashboard using Tkinter, YAML, and psutil.

**3. Endpoint Ransomware Behavior Analysis Engine**  
Trained ML models to detect ransomware-like behavior based on encryption patterns and system behavior. Isolates risky processes and logs detailed activity for forensic review.

**4. AI Resume Screener**  
Created an intelligent resume analysis tool using LangChain and OpenAI APIs. Processes resumes in real-time and identifies candidate-job fit with a 70% reduction in manual effort.

**5. System Log Anomaly Detection Framework**  
Used Isolation Forest and Pandas to parse and analyze thousands of log entries. Detects unusual patterns and visualizes risk clusters to aid in faster incident response.
